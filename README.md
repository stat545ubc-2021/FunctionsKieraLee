#if this is a very basic data set that you are working with 
fruit <- data.frame(fruit_type = c("apple","apple","apple", "orange", "orange","orange","plum","plum","plum"),
                      number = c(10,7,45,3,45,67,89,0,12))

#using the function summary_statistics()
summary_statistics(fruit, number, fruit_type)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 Ã— 6
    ##   fruit_type  mean median standard_deviation   max   min
    ##   <chr>      <dbl>  <dbl>              <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 apple       20.7     10               21.1    45     7
    ## 2 orange      38.3     45               32.5    67     3
